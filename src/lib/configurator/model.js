 * We have no 3D mesh assets (the source DWGs carry only the flat "Mobilier 2D"
 * plan layer; Ligne Roset's real 3D models live in the dealer's pCon/OFML trade
 * channel). So the interim 3D view GENERATES each Togo piece from its footprint:
 * the iconic Togo is a low, legless pile of puffy, ribbed cushions, which a few
 * generously-rounded boxes approximate well. This module returns ONLY numbers
 * (cm) — no three.js — so it's unit-testable and the renderer just maps each
 * part to a RoundedBox. When real GLBs arrive, the renderer swaps mesh-loading
 * in per piece and this becomes the fallback.
 *
 * Coordinates (per piece, centred on the floor): X = width (left↔right),
 * Z = depth (back ↔ front: back at −Z, the open front at +Z), Y = up (floor 0).
 * Cushions split into ribs so the silhouette reads as Togo, not a slab.
