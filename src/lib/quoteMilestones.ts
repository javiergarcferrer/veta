/**
 * Quote-level commerce milestones — the three timestamps that track
 * what the *customer* has done with their cotización, independent of
 * the order's logistics lifecycle (which lives in orderStages.js).
 *
 *   depositReceivedAt  →  client paid the down payment.
 *                         The dealer's words: "el acto de confirmar
 *                         la cotización es recibir el depósito".
 *                         This is the moment a quote becomes a
 *                         committed sale.
 *
 *   balancePaidAt      →  client paid the remaining balance.
 *                         Required before delivery: "el balance se
 *                         debe marcar antes de entregar".
 *
 *   deliveredAt        →  client has taken physical delivery of
 *                         their goods.
 *
 * The chain is strictly ordered for marking: you can't record a
 * balance without a deposit, and you can't record a delivery without
 * a balance and without the parent order being in 'recibido'. Each
 * step can still be UN-marked freely (the dealer may need to correct
 * a typo or a wrong date); the gates only restrict the forward edge.
 *
 * Why a separate file from orderStages.js
 * ---------------------------------------
 * The order's stage lives on the order row; these three live on the
 * quote row. Keeping the helpers next to the data they read from
 * makes it obvious which entity each milestone belongs to and avoids
 * the previous version's coupling, where order-level helpers
 * pretended to know about quote-level fulfillment.
