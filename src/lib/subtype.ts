/**
 * Subtype is one free-text column on the line row, but in practice dealers
 * write two distinct concepts into it: a fabric/leather *grade* (the price
 * tier — A, B, C… or COM) and a *finish* name (the actual fabric, leather,
 * or wood variant — PAMPA, Velvet Smoke, Walnut, etc.).
 *
 * The UI splits the field into two editors (a Grade dropdown + a Fabric
 * input). This module is the bridge: parse a stored subtype into the two
 * concepts on read, and compose them back into the canonical string on
 * write — without ever requiring a DB migration.
 *
 * Canonical compose format mirrors the price list:
 *
 *   "Grade C — PAMPA"     (alpha grade A..X excluding T/Y/Z)
 *   "Grade U — Tea"       (leather grade is just another letter)
 *   "COM — buyer supplied"
 *   "Grade C"             (grade alone)
 *   "PAMPA"               (fabric alone, no grade)
 *
 * Parse is tolerant: anything we don't recognize as a grade is treated as
 * pure fabric, so legacy strings the dealer hand-typed (e.g. "Walnut",
 * "Cuir — Tea") round-trip intact.
